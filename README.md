A simple game to help H & S learn to type. 

I'm going to build it in both Javascript and Go. I'm
more familiar in Javascript so I'm hoping that it will help me
learn Go better because I'll only need to think through the 
Go side not the structure of the project.

Requirements:
- list Top 5 attempts of all time
- lives
- Score
- modes (easy - home row, medium all letters, 
    hard - all numbers and common symbols, insane - All keys
- Letters drop from top to bottom and 
- Drop more letters over time
- Bonus material
- - Levels
- - Elapsed Time - display and report
- - Most incorrect typed letters
- - gain lives (perhaps a key combo?
- - think about keycombos
